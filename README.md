A simple program to backup a single folder/location to many other location

-Place the location that you want to backup in the 'WhatToBackup.txt' file
-List all of the other locations to where you would like to backup in the 'BackuoLocations.txt' file

*Do not use "" around the file paths

The paths of the folders/files are listed in the thingstobackup.txt file

the paths of the places where these folders/files will be backedup to will be listed in the backuplocation.txt file


When the code runs each of the thingstobackup.txt will be backedup to the locations of backuplocation.txt

As it iterated thru the txt files everything in the locations will be backed up
